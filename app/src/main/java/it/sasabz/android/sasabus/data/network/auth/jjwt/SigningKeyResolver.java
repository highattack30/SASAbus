/**
 * A {@code SigningKeyResolver} can be used by a {@link JwtParser JwtParser} to find a signing key that
 * should be used to verify a JWS signature.
 * <p>
 * <p>A {@code SigningKeyResolver} is necessary when the signing key is not already known before parsing the JWT and the
 * JWT header or payload (plaintext body or Claims) must be inspected first to determine how to look up the signing key.
 * Once returned by the resolver, the JwtParser will then verify the JWS signature with the returned key.  For
 * example:</p>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * Jws&lt;Claims&gt; jws = Jwts.parser().setSigningKeyResolver(new SigningKeyResolverAdapter() {
 *         &#64;Override
 *         public byte[] resolveSigningKeyBytes(JwsHeader header, Claims claims) {
 *             //inspect the header or claims, lookup and return the signing key
 *             return getSigningKeyBytes(header, claims); //implement me
 *         }})
 *     .parseClaimsJws(compact);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <p>A {@code SigningKeyResolver} is invoked once during parsing before the signature is verified.</p>
 * <p>
 * <h4>SigningKeyResolverAdapter</h4>
 * <p>
 * <p>If you only need to resolve a signing key for a particular JWS (either a plaintext or Claims JWS), consider using
 * the {@link SigningKeyResolverAdapter} and overriding only the method you need to support instead of
 * implementing this interface directly.</p>
